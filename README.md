## 1. About the Project

The **Adaptive Learning Platform** is an innovative web application designed to personalize the educational journey for students, providing dynamic content and assessments tailored to their individual needs. Leveraging the power of local Artificial Intelligence, the platform ensures privacy and offline functionality, making advanced learning tools accessible on standard hardware. It serves as a comprehensive educational companion for students and a content management tool for doctors (teachers).

**Purpose:**
In response to the generic "one-size-fits-all" approach in traditional education, this platform aims to deliver a highly customizable learning experience. It empowers students with intelligent resources and enables educators to manage and deliver targeted content and assessments efficiently.

---

## 5. Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the Adaptive Learning Platform running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
* `Python 3.8+` (ensure you're using a version compatible with `llama_cpp-python` and other libraries)
* `pip` (Python package installer)
* `MySQL Server` installed and running on your machine.
* `git` (optional, for cloning the repository)

### Database Setup
1.  **Create MySQL Database:**
    Open your MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, command line) and execute:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE adaptive_learning_db;
    CREATE USER 'adaptive_learning_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON adaptive_learning_db.* TO 'adaptive_learning_user'@'localhost';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    ```
    **Remember to replace `your_password` with a strong password.**
2.  **Update `config.py`:**
    Open `config.py` in the project root and update the MySQL connection details:
    ```python
    # config.py
    # ...
    MYSQL_HOST = 'localhost'
    MYSQL_USER = 'adaptive_learning_user'
    MYSQL_PASSWORD = 'your_password' # Use the password you set above
    MYSQL_DB = 'adaptive_learning_db'
    # ...
    ```

### API Keys
1.  **YouTube Data API Key:**
    * Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    * Create a new project.
    * Navigate to `APIs & Services > Library`, search for "YouTube Data API v3", and **Enable** it.
    * Go to `APIs & Services > Credentials`, click `+ CREATE CREDENTIALS` and choose `API Key`.
    * **Restrict** the API key to "YouTube Data API v3" under "API restrictions". For local testing, you can leave "Application restrictions" as "None".
    * Update `config.py` with your new key:
        ```python
        # config.py
        # ...
        YOUTUBE_API_KEY = 'YOUR_ACTUAL_YOUTUBE_API_KEY_HERE'
        # ...
        ```

### Model Downloads
1.  **Mistral-7B LLM:**
    The application uses `Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2.Q2_K.gguf` for LLM inference.
    * Create a directory named `llm_models/` in your project root.
    * Download the model file: [mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q2_K.gguf from TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF/blob/main/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q2_K.gguf)
    * Place the downloaded `.gguf` file into the `llm_models/` directory.
2.  **Sentence-Transformers Embedding Model:**
    The application uses `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for embeddings. This model will be **automatically downloaded and cached** by the `sentence-transformers` library the first time you run the app (requires internet for this first download).

### Installation Steps
1.  **Clone the Repository (if applicable) or navigate to project folder:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/adaptive-learning-platform.git](https://github.com/yourusername/adaptive-learning-platform.git)
    cd adaptive-learning-platform
    ```
2.  **Create a Python Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    * **Windows:** `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
    * **macOS/Linux:** `source venv/bin/activate`
    *(Your terminal prompt should now show `(venv)` or similar.)*
4.  **Install Required Python Packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install Flask Flask-MySQLdb Werkzeug chromadb sentence-transformers pypdf python-docx google-api-python-client easyocr
    ```
5.  **Clean Cache (Recommended before first run):**
    Delete any `__pycache__` folders in your project directory (e.g., `adaptive_learning_app/__pycache__`, `models/__pycache__`). This helps avoid conflicts from previous debug sessions.

### Running the Application
1.  **Ensure Virtual Environment is Active.**
2.  **Run Flask Server:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    * The first time running, `EasyOCR` and `sentence-transformers` will download their models. This requires internet.
    * Observe your terminal for `DEBUG:` messages confirming table creation and LLM/RAG component loading.
3.  Open your web browser and go to: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

### Initial Data Seeding
After running `python app.py` for the first time (which creates the database tables), you'll need to seed some initial data:

1.  **Register a Doctor User:**
    * Go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/register`
    * Register a user with role `Doctor` (e.g., `doctor@example.com`, password `testpass`). Select at least 3 courses.
    * Complete the initial document upload page.
2.  **Seed Default Courses:**
    * **In a NEW terminal window**, activate your virtual environment.
    * Navigate to your project root.
    * Run `flask shell`.
    * Carefully paste the following script (replace `doctor@example.com` with your doctor's email if different):
        ```python
        from app import app
        from models import Course, User
        with app.app_context():
            doctor_user_obj = User.find_by_email('doctor@example.com') 
            doctor_user_id = None
            if doctor_user_obj:
                doctor_user_id = doctor_user_obj.id
            
            if not doctor_user_id:
                print("--- WARNING: Doctor user not found. Please register one first. ---")
            else:
                print(f"--- Found doctor user ID: {doctor_user_id}. Proceeding with course creation. ---")
                default_courses_data = [
                    {'name': 'Calculus I', 'description': 'Limits, derivatives, and integrals of functions.'},
                    {'name': 'Linear Algebra', 'description': 'Vectors, matrices, and linear transformations.'},

                    {'name': 'Organic Chemistry I', 'description': 'Introduction to the structure, properties, and reactions of organic compounds.'},
                    {'name': 'Quantum Physics', 'description': 'Principles of quantum mechanics and its applications.'},
                    {'name': 'Machine Learning Basics', 'description': 'Introduction to supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.'},
                ]
                print("\nAttempting to save default courses:")
                for course_data in default_courses_data:
                    course = Course(name=course_data['name'], description=course_data['description'], created_by_user_id=doctor_user_id)
                    if course.save():
                        print(f"- {course_data['name']} added.")
                    else:
                        print(f"- Failed to add {course_data['name']} (might already exist or DB error).")
                print("\nAll courses currently in DB:")
                print(Course.get_all_courses())
        ```
    * Press `Enter` twice after pasting.
    * Type `exit()` and press `Enter` to leave the shell.
